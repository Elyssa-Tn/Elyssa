# Project ELYSSA

Welcome to ELYSSA, an innovative tool developed as part of ERC TARICA's research on political and socio-institutional changes in the Maghreb.

This ERC Proof of Concept project is a platform for exploring, visualizing, and analyzing electoral data in Tunisia and the Maghreb post-2011. Leveraging a comprehensive electoral database built over the past 5 years, ELYSSA is designed to facilitate access to election-related information, aiding various users such as NGOs, media, political actors, and cooperation institutions.

This tool contributes to the democratization of electoral information, strengthening civil society's understanding of political processes in the region. The project, funded as a recognition of the valuable work undertaken in ERC TARICA, will support the updating of existing data, the collection of new data for upcoming Tunisian elections, identification of user needs, and the ongoing development of the technical tool. Explore ELYSSA and empower your insights into Maghreb's electoral landscape.
